    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This shrimp cocktail recipe is similar to one I first tried in San Antonio. 
        I could never find a recipe that recaptured what I had there. 
        I experimented and finally came up with the perfect combination of ingredients. 
        Anyone who has tried it has begged for the recipe. Try it with tortilla chips!</p>
